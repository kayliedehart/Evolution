Memo

The dealer calls this method if:
- The player's move isn't automatic
  - the player's move is automatic if:
    - the player only has one hungry species that is not a carnivore
    - the player has no species to feed (all its existing species are full)
    - there is no food in the watering hole and the player has no carnivore species
- It is the player's turn

The dealer applies the results if:
- The the move is legal
  - if carnivore the carnivore can attack
  - if fat tissue/herbavore the food ammount is appropriate
  - the player is feeding one of its own species
  - there is enough food in the watering hole to complete the move
